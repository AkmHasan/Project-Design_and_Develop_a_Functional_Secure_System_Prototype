# Project-Design_and_Develop_a_Functional_Secure_System_Prototype
ABC Air is a small aircraft service company that carries out aircraft maintenance for civil operators, I have been contacted by them and they asked me to design and develop a functional security system for them and implement the secure online system. 


Indicative Delivery to its client, all explained below:
 
The Prototype is scheduled for delivery as follows (subject to change): 
  
1. Cyber Security in the Software Development Life Cycle - 
   a. Examine security in the software development life cycle and discuss the legal and ethical aspects of secure systems.
   
2. System Analysis and Design - 
   a. The fundamental methods and techniques of system analysis and secure design.
   
3. System Development - 
   a. Acquire core security practices and techniques applied to the secure development of systems.
   
4. System Testing and Maintenance - 
   a. Used a range of testing and verification techniques for the examination of system security and function.
   
5. Big Issues in Secure Development - 
   a. Discussed and examine current limitations of secure design and development.
   
 I have used other technologies, see below:

	PHP - Server-side scripting used to manage dynamic content of ABC Air.

 HTML and CSS - I used it because it's necessary to create the actual contents of the pages and necessary to provide ease of access and readability to users. Simply, they      provide  structure and visual layout for the app, and also, HTML and CSS and the colour vision and structure.

Bootstrap - I used to develop the front end of the app, which is to support the development of the records functionality.

JQuery - This is a javascript framework that greatly simplifies HTML document filtering and control for this prototype.

MySQL (Structured Query Language) - It holds the database information that is being stored.
